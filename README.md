# Mass-Transfer-with-Reaction-CFD
This project demonstrates the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to a real-world engineering problem. During my midterm exam in Fluid Dynamics, I developed a CFD model to simulate a Plug Flow Reactor (PFR) for the steam reforming reaction, a crucial process in methanol and DME production. The simulation generated detailed contour plots of velocity, pressure drop, and mass fraction for each compound involved in the reaction. A comprehensive discussion of the project and its findings can be found in the attached PPT file.
